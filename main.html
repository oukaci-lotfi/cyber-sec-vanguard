<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my very basic webpage</p></br>
<p>My name is OUKACI Lotfi Merzak, a soon-to-be computer systems security engineer</p></br>
<p>Well, website developing isn't really my thing<p></br>
<p>In addition to that, HMTL and CSS are somewhat boring, sorry!<p></br>
<p>So I will leave my website as basic as it is, I might add some CSS later on, because I enjoy beauty anyway<p></br>
<p>And, I will use this website to share what I am learning, and to show off that I am a very very very very very very very skilled cyber_sec engineer<p></br>
<p>For now, I am reading a 1400 pages book, I assume you already know what it is ;)<p></br>
